**What?** Pytest plugin for testing and releasing notebook documentation

**Why?** To raise the quality of scientific material through better automation

**Who is this for?** Research/Machine Learning Software Engineers who maintain packages/teaching materials with documentation written in notebooks.

## Functionality

1. Executes notebooks using pytest and nbclient, allowing parallel notebook testing
2. Optionally writes back to the repo, allowing faster building of [nbsphinx](https://github.com/spatialaudio/nbsphinx) or [jupyter book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) docs
3. Optionally builds an HTML report using [jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) of the test run which can be uploaded to hosting providers such as Netlify.

**See [docs](https://treebeardtech.github.io/nbmake) to get started.**
